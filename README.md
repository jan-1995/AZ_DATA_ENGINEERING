# AZ_DATA_ENGINEERING
Product Sales Analytics with Azure Dataa Engineering

## Project Overview

The aim of this project was to ingest raw data from an on premises SQL server containing Azure's sample prodcut sales data (which can be found on kaggle), creating an ingesting and data transformation and loading ETL using Microsoft's native tool called Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Bricks and Synapse, and then ultimately load the data into Power BI and gain possible data driven insights from this data. This is an End to End Data Engineering Project which is why I urge the person reading this to practice and go through this entire project with data of their choice

### What's Inside:

- **Data Ingestion Scripts**: Scripts used with Azure Data Factory to ingest data from Git raw URLs.
- **Data Transformation Notebooks**: Azure Databricks notebooks containing Spark code for data transformations.
- **Visualization Dashboards**: Samples or links to PowerBI dashboards created from the processed data.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the processes and code.

## Tech Stack

- **Azure Data Factory**: For data ingestion.
- **Azure Data Lake Gen 2**: Used as our primary data storage.
- **Azure Databricks**: For data processing and transformation.
- **PowerBI**: For creating insightful visualizations.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: For Data Loading
